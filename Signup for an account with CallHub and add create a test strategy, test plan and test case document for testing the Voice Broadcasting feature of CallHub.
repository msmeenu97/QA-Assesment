		. Test Cases
		. Defect logs/reports of the tests

Estimation - 	The overall feature with manual and automated test will be taking an overall average of 18-20 		man hours. COmplete Test report- 8-10 man-hours (Estimated)
Test Deliverables= 

		Test deliverables provided before testing phase.

		1.Test plans document.
		2. Test cases documents
		3.Test Design specifications.



Items to be Tested/Description - 1. USer creates an account on the site, and after logging , can create a new voice broadcast . The user should be able to create the same, everytime s/he clicks on the create tab
2. Verify that the voice is audible, and the person is able to record it properly.

Test Strategy -
	1. Test Approach- * Roles/responsibilities of each member.
	* Types of testing that will be performed eg- unit,functional, regression, etc
	* Defect management cycle- to decsribe where the new defect should n=be logged and how. To 	effectively use this, JIRA will be a better suitable tool
	* Test Environment- Test environment setup should outline information about a number of environments 				and required setup for each environment. Would be prefarable to use Dev and QA as 		separate environments, and Production environemnt for release 
	* Testing Tools- Overview of the testing tools that will be used throughout the testing phase eg. 		Eclipse/Selenium for regression, Jmeter for performance etc
	* TAsk distribution- The feature will be equally distributed in task terms between each of the 	members, who will be preparing the test cases,and executing them, The test cases will be tagged under 	names of smoke/regression/unit/ Test status- Passed/failed/Deferred/Duplicate/discarded

	
Review and Approvals - The entire test plan/starategy document will be reviewd by the project loead/test 	manager, and after successful approval and through analysis, the plan will be carried out   



Test Results/reports-
		1. Defect Report
		2. Installation/ Test procedures guidelines
		3. Release Notes
